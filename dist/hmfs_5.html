                <h3>What is Financial Markets?</h3>
                <p>Financial markets are platforms where buyers and sellers trade financial assets such as stocks,
                    bonds, currencies, and commodities. These markets facilitate the flow of capital and liquidity in
                    the economy, enabling businesses to grow and individuals to invest. There are several types of
                    financial markets, including stock markets, bond markets, commodity markets, and foreign exchange
                    markets.</p>

                <h3>Stock Markets</h3>
                <p>Stock markets are venues where shares of publicly listed companies are bought and sold. They provide
                    companies with access to capital in exchange for giving investors a slice of ownership in the
                    company. Major stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. In 2020,
                    the global stock market capitalization was approximately $95 trillion.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Equities. Investing in stocks can provide capital appreciation
                    and dividends, with historical average annual returns of 7% to 10%.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The oldest stock exchange in the world is the Amsterdam Stock
                    Exchange, established in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company.</p>

                <h3>Bond Markets</h3>
                <p>The bond market is where participants can issue new debt or buy and sell debt securities.
                    Governments, municipalities, and corporations issue bonds to raise funds for various projects.
                    Investors purchase bonds to receive periodic interest payments and the return of principal at
                    maturity. Bond prices fluctuate based on interest rates and credit risk, influencing their
                    attractiveness to investors. The global bond market size was around $123.5 trillion in 2020.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Government and Corporate Bonds. Bonds offer lower risk and
                    stable returns, with average yields ranging from 1% to 5% per annum, depending on the issuer's
                    creditworthiness.</p>

                <h3>Advantages of Bond Markets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a platform for buying and selling bonds, making it easier for investors to access
                        funds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Offer a variety of bonds with different maturities, issuers, and risk levels, enhancing
                        portfolio diversification.
                    </li>
                    <li>Regulated, ensuring transparency and fair pricing for investors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disadvantages of Bond Markets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bond prices are highly sensitive to interest rate changes, which can lead to market
                        volatility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Investors face the risk of issuers defaulting on their payments, particularly with lower-rated
                        bonds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Compared to equities and other high-risk investments, bond markets generally provide lower
                        returns.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    global trade and investments. Major currency pairs include EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Currency Trading. Forex trading can be highly profitable but

                    include metals like gold and silver, energy resources like oil and natural gas, and agricultural

                    (LME).</p>

                    inflation and provide diversification, with potential returns varying widely depending on market
                    conditions.</p>

                <p>Do you know that gold has been used as a form of currency and a store of value for over 5,000 years?</p>

                <h3>Derivatives Markets</h3>
                <p>Derivatives markets involve financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of underlying
                    assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. Common derivatives include futures,
                    options, and swaps. They are used for hedging risk or speculative purposes. Derivatives can also
                    enhance portfolio performance through strategic leverage.</p>

                    in an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Secondary markets are where existing securities are traded
                    among investors. The secondary market provides liquidity and the ability for investors to buy and
                    sell securities easily.</p>
