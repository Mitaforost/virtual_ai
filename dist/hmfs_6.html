                </div>

                <h3>Introduction to Investments</h3>
                <p>Investments are assets or items acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. The
                    essence of investing is to put your money into financial products, properties, or ventures with the
                    expectation of obtaining a future financial return. Understanding different investment methods is
                    crucial for making informed financial decisions.</p>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The concept of investing dates back to ancient times, although the
                    modern stock market began in the 1600s in Amsterdam.</p>

                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                <p>Stocks represent shares of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner
                    of that company. Stocks are known for their potential for high returns but come with higher risk.
                    Investors often buy stocks through stock exchanges, where prices fluctuate based on market
                    conditions.</p>

                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The NYSE was established in 1792 with the signing of the Buttonwood
                    Agreement by 24 New York City stockbrokers and merchants.</p>

                <h3>Bonds</h3>
                <p>Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations, municipalities, or governments to raise capital.
                    When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic
                    interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity. Bonds are typically
                    considered safer investments compared to stocks but usually offer lower returns.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-2.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The U.S. government issues a bond known as the Treasury
                    Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) which offers protection against inflation.</p>

                <h3>Mutual Funds</h3>
                <p>Mutual funds pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or
                    other securities. Managed by professional fund managers, mutual funds provide an easy way for
                    individuals to diversify their investments. The diversification helps reduce risk, but mutual funds
                    come with management fees.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-3.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The first modern mutual fund, Massachusetts Investors Trust, started
                    in 1924 and is still in operation today.</p>

                <h3>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h3>
                <p>ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks on stock exchanges. They offer diversification
                    by holding a variety of assets and are typically passively managed, which can result in lower fees.
                    ETFs provide flexibility as they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market
                    prices.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-4.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The first ETF was introduced in Canada in 1990.</p>

                <h3>Real Estate</h3>
                <p>Real estate investing involves purchasing properties to generate income or appreciation. Investors
                    can earn money through rental income, property appreciation, or both. Real estate is considered a
                    tangible asset and can be a good hedge against inflation, but it requires significant capital and
                    management effort.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-5.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> About 30% of real estate buyers in the U.S. are first-timers,
                    according to National Association of Realtors.</p>

                <h3>Commodities</h3>
                <p>Commodities are raw materials or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as
                    gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products. Investing in commodities can be done directly through
                    physical purchases or indirectly through futures contracts and ETFs. Commodities can provide
                    diversification and act as a hedge against inflation, but they can be volatile.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-6.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> Humans have been trading commodities for thousands of years, with
                    evidence dating back to ancient Sumer.</p>

                <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. Bitcoin and
                    Ethereum are among the most well-known cryptocurrencies. Investing in cryptocurrencies can offer
                    high returns but comes with significant risk and volatility. The market for cryptocurrencies is
                    relatively new and can be unpredictable.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-7.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in
                    2009 by an anonymous person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

                <h3>Peer-to-Peer Lending</h3>
                <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms connect borrowers with investors directly, bypassing traditional
                    banks. Investors can earn interest by lending money to individuals or small businesses. P2P lending
                    offers potentially higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts, but it also carries the
                    risk of borrower default.</p>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The first online peer-to-peer lending platform, Zopa, was launched in
                    the UK in 2005.</p>

                <h3>Diversification and Risk Management</h3>
                <p>Diversification involves spreading investments across various asset classes to reduce risk. By
                    diversifying, investors can mitigate the impact of a poor-performing investment on their overall
                    portfolio. Risk management is crucial in investing, as it helps protect against significant losses
                    and ensures a balanced approach to achieving financial goals.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L6-8.png" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The phrase "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" can aptly apply to
                    the concept of investment diversification.</p>
