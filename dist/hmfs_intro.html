                <h3>The Concept of Money</h3>
                <p>Money, at its core, is what we use to buy goods and services. It serves three main purposes: <span>a medium
                    of exchange, a store of value</span>, and <span>a unit of account</span>. Before money existed,
                    people traded goods
                    directly, which was often tricky because both parties had to want what the other was offering. This
                    system, known as barter, was inefficient and limited the growth of economies. Over time, people
                    began using items like cattle, grains, and shells as early forms of money, which eventually led to
                    the use of precious metals and, later, coins.</p>

                <h3>The Functions of Money</h3>

                    <tr>

                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Example</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Medium of Exchange</td>
                        <td>Money facilitates trade by eliminating the need for a direct barter.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Store of Value</td>
                        <td>Money preserves value over time, allowing savings for future use.</td>
                        <td>Saving money in a bank account for future purchases.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Unit of Account</td>
                        <td>Money provides a standard measure of value for goods and services.</td>
                        <td>Pricing items in a store using currency (e.g., $10).</td>
                    </tr>

                </table>

                <p>Did you know that in ancient Mesopotamia, people used barley as a form of money? It was both a staple
                    food and a widely accepted means of exchange.
                </p>

                <h3>The Development of Currency</h3>
                <p>As trade expanded, so did the need for more convenient forms of money. The introduction of coins,
                    made from metals like gold and silver, provided a standardized value, making trade much easier.
                    Later, paper money was introduced, allowing people to carry and transfer larger amounts of wealth
                    more easily. Governments and central authorities played a key role in standardizing currency,
                    ensuring its value and facilitating trade both within and across regions.</p>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The first recorded use of paper money was in China during the Tang
                    Dynasty (618-907 AD), long before it was adopted in the West.</p>

                <h3>The Role of Banks</h3>
                <p>Banks have a long history, evolving from simple storage facilities to complex institutions that drive
                    the global economy. Early banks emerged in ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome, where they
                    stored grain and other commodities. Over time, these institutions began offering loans, accepting
                    deposits, and facilitating currency exchange. The functions of early banks laid the groundwork for
                    modern banking systems.</p>

                        <th>Function</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Temples in Greece</td>
                        <td>Safekeeping of valuables</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Roman "Argentarii"</td>
                        <td>Currency exchange and loans</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Medici Bank (Italy)</td>
                        <td>Facilitated trade and credit</td>

                    </tbody>

                <h3>The Financial System</h3>
                <p>The financial system is the network that allows money to move through the economy, connecting
                    individuals, businesses, and governments. It consists of key components like financial institutions
                    (banks, credit unions), financial markets (stock and bond markets), financial instruments (stocks,
                    bonds), and regulatory bodies (like the SEC in the U.S.). Together, these components facilitate the
                    flow of money, enabling savings, investments, and economic growth.</p>

                <h3>Role of Financial Institutions</h3>
                <p>Financial institutions play several key roles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide safe places for saving and investing money</li>
                    <li>Offer loans to individuals and businesses</li>
                    <li>Facilitate payments and manage financial risks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Financial markets are vital because they enable companies to raise capital for expansion and
                    innovation by issuing stocks and bonds. These markets also provide individuals with opportunities to
                    invest, helping them grow their wealth over time. Moreover, they play a key role in determining the
                    prices of financial assets, which reflects the overall health of the economy and guides investment
                    decisions.</p>
