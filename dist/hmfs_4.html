                </div>
                <h3>Types of Financial Institutions</h3>
                <p>Financial institutions are organizations that provide services related to money management. The main
                    types include banks, credit unions, insurance companies, pension funds, and investment firms. Banks
                    are the most common, offering checking and savings accounts, loans, and mortgages. Credit unions are
                    similar but are owned by their members and often provide better interest rates. Insurance companies
                    help manage risk by offering policies that pay out in case of accidents or other losses. Pension
                    funds collect and invest money to provide retirees with a steady income. Investment firms manage
                    assets and provide financial advice.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The oldest bank still in operation is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena
                    in Italy, founded in 1472.</p>

                <h3>Central Banks</h3>
                <p>Central banks are crucial for a country's economic stability. They control the money supply and set
                    interest rates, which influences inflation and employment. Examples include the Federal Reserve in
                    the United States and the European Central Bank. Central banks use tools like open market operations
                    and reserve requirements to manage the economy. By adjusting interest rates, they can either
                    encourage borrowing and spending or promote saving and reduce inflation.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Government Bonds. Issued by central banks, these are low-risk
                    investments that typically yield 1% to 3% per annum, suitable for conservative investors.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The Federal Reserve, often called "the Fed," was established in 1913
                    after a series of financial panics highlighted the need for central control of the monetary system.
                </p>

                <h3>Commercial Banks</h3>
                <p>Commercial banks are where most people manage their everyday finances. They accept deposits, provide
                    checking and savings accounts, and offer loans for cars, homes, and businesses. By lending money,
                    banks help stimulate economic growth. In return, they earn interest on loans, which is a major
                    source of their revenue. In 2020, the total assets of the banking sector in the U.S. were
                    approximately $22 trillion.</p>

                <p>Examples of Commercial Banks include JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Savings Accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Savings
                    accounts offer 0.5% to 2% per annum, while CDs can provide 1% to 3% per annum, both with minimal
                    risks. They are a safe starting point for new investors.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Investment Banks</h3>
                <p>Investment banks help companies and governments raise capital by underwriting and issuing securities.
                    They also advise on mergers and acquisitions and trade securities on behalf of clients. Unlike
                    commercial banks, they do not take deposits. Famous investment banks include Goldman Sachs and
                    Morgan Stanley. These banks play a vital role in the financial markets, helping to ensure liquidity
                    and stability.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Stocks and Bonds. Investment banks facilitate the buying and
                    selling of stocks and bonds, which can yield average returns of 7% to 10% per annum for stocks and
                    3% to 5% for bonds, with moderate to high risks.</p>

                <p><span>Did you know:</span> Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 and has survived numerous financial
                    crises, including the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis?</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Credit Unions</h3>
                <p>Credit unions are cooperative institutions owned by their members, who are also their customers. They
                    offer similar services to commercial banks but often provide better interest rates and lower fees
                    because they are non-profit organizations. Membership is typically based on a common bond, such as
                    employment or community. In 2020, there were over 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. with more than 120
                    million members.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Savings Accounts and Loans. Credit union savings accounts
                    generally offer 1% to 3% per annum, and personal loans have lower interest rates compared to banks,
                    making them attractive for members.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Insurance Companies</h3>
                <p>Insurance companies provide risk management by offering policies that compensate individuals or
                    businesses in case of loss, damage, or liability. Types of insurance include life, health, property,
                    and casualty insurance. They collect premiums and invest the funds to pay out claims. Major
                    insurance companies include Allstate and Prudential. In 2019, the global insurance industry had
                    total premiums of over $6 trillion.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Annuities and Insurance Products. Insurance companies offer
                    annuities that can provide a steady income stream, with potential returns of 3% to 6% per annum,
                    appealing to those seeking stable retirement income.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> Lloyd's of London, established in 1688, is one of the oldest insurance
                    marketplaces and is known for insuring unique risks, such as celebrity body parts.</p>

                <h3>Pension Funds</h3>
                <p>Pension funds are investment pools that pay for workers' retirements. They collect contributions from
                    employers and employees during the workers' careers and invest the funds to grow over time. Upon
                    retirement, workers receive regular payments from the fund. As of 2020, the largest public pension
                    fund in the world is Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, managing over $1.5 trillion in
                    assets. Examples include the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS).</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Retirement Accounts. Pension funds typically invest in a
                    diversified portfolio that can yield average returns of 5% to 8% per annum, making them a
                    cornerstone for long-term retirement planning.</p>

                <p>By the way, do you know how it started? The concept of pensions dates back to ancient Rome, where
                    soldiers were promised pensions as a reward for their service.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Mutual Funds and ETFs</h3>
                <p>Mutual funds pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or
                    other securities, managed by professional fund managers. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are similar
                    but trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. Both provide diversification and are accessible
                    to individual investors. As of 2021, the global mutual fund industry managed assets worth over $50
                    trillion.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Mutual Funds and ETFs. These can yield average returns of 5% to
                    10% per annum, depending on the fund's risk profile, suitable for individual investors seeking
                    diversified exposure.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Hedge Funds and Private Equity</h3>
                <p>Hedge funds are private investment funds that use a variety of strategies to achieve high returns,
                    often involving significant risk. Private equity involves investing in private companies to
                    restructure and improve them for a future sale or public offering. These investments are typically
                    accessible only to accredited investors. In 2020, the global hedge fund industry managed assets
                    worth approximately $3.6 trillion.</p>

                    <li><strong>Private Equity:</strong> Suitable for long-term investors seeking returns of 15% to 20%

                <h3>Regulatory Bodies</h3>
                <p>Regulatory bodies oversee financial institutions to ensure they operate fairly, transparently, and
                    efficiently. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates securities markets,
                    while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) does so in the U.K. These bodies protect investors and
                    maintain market integrity by enforcing laws and regulations.</p>

                <p><span>Investment Opportunity:</span> Regulated Investment Products. Investments in products regulated
                    by bodies like the SEC can provide transparency and security, appealing to conservative investors.
                </p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The SEC was established in 1934 in response to the stock market crash
                    of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression.</p>
