                <h3>Types of Financial Institutions</h3>
                <p>Financial institutions are organizations that provide services related to money management. The main
                    types include banks, credit unions, insurance companies, pension funds, and investment firms. Banks
                    are the most common, offering checking and savings accounts, loans, and mortgages. Credit unions are
                    similar but are owned by their members and often provide better interest rates. Insurance companies
                    help manage risk by offering policies that pay out in case of accidents or other losses. Pension
                    funds collect and invest money to provide retirees with a steady income. Investment firms manage
                    assets and provide financial advice.</p>

                <p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> The oldest bank still in operation is Banca Monte dei Paschi di
                    Siena in Italy, founded in 1472.</p>

                <h3>Central Banks</h3>
                <p>Central banks are crucial for a country's economic stability. They control the money supply and set
                    interest rates, which influences inflation and employment. Examples include the Federal Reserve in
                    the United States and the European Central Bank. Central banks use tools like open market operations
                    and reserve requirements to manage the economy. By adjusting interest rates, they can either
                    encourage borrowing and spending or promote saving and reduce inflation.</p>

                <p><strong>Investment Opportunity:</strong> Government Bonds. Issued by central banks, these are
                    low-risk investments that typically yield 1% to 3% per annum, suitable for conservative investors.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> The Federal Reserve, often called "the Fed," was established in
                    1913 after a series of financial panics highlighted the need for central control of the monetary
                    system.</p>

                <h3>Commercial Banks</h3>
                <p>Commercial banks are where most people manage their everyday finances. They accept deposits, provide
                    checking and savings accounts, and offer loans for cars, homes, and businesses. By lending money,
                    banks help stimulate economic growth. In return, they earn interest on loans, which is a major
                    source of their revenue. In 2020, the total assets of the banking sector in the U.S. were
                    approximately $22 trillion.</p>

                <p><strong>Examples of Commercial Banks:</strong> JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.</p>

                <p><strong>Investment Opportunity:</strong> Savings Accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Savings
                    accounts offer 0.5% to 2% per annum, while CDs can provide 1% to 3% per annum, both with minimal
                    risks. They are a safe starting point for new investors.</p>

                <h3>Investment Banks</h3>
                <p>Investment banks help companies and governments raise capital by underwriting and issuing securities.
                    They also advise on mergers and acquisitions and trade securities on behalf of clients. Unlike
                    commercial banks, they do not take deposits. Famous investment banks include Goldman Sachs and
                    Morgan Stanley. These banks play a vital role in the financial markets, helping to ensure liquidity
                    and stability.</p>

                <p><strong>Investment Opportunity:</strong> Investment banks offer various high-risk, high-reward
                    opportunities, including IPOs and complex financial instruments. Suitable for more experienced
                    investors.</p>
