                <h3>What is Personal Finance?</h3>
                <p>Personal finance is the practice of managing your money wisely to ensure that you can meet your daily
                    needs and achieve your long-term goals. It involves several key activities, such as budgeting,
                    saving, investing, and managing debt. These activities are crucial because they help you make the
                    most of the money you have, avoid financial stress, and build a stable future.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Importance of Budgeting</h3>
                <p>Budgeting is the cornerstone of personal finance. It’s a simple process that involves tracking how
                    much money you earn and how much you spend. By creating a budget, you can make sure you’re not
                    spending more than you earn, which is a common cause of financial stress.</p>

                <p>A good budget will help you allocate your income towards essential expenses like rent, utilities, and
                    groceries, while also leaving room for saving and discretionary spending on things like
                    entertainment or dining out. Many people find that once they start budgeting, they have more control
                    over their finances and can even find extra money to save or invest.</p>

                <p>Let us introduce you to the 50/30/20 rule:</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Setting Up a Savings Plan</h3>
                <p>Saving money is a crucial part of financial health. Whether you're saving for a big purchase, an
                    emergency fund, or retirement, having a plan in place makes it easier to reach your goals. Start by
                    setting aside a small portion of your income each month. Even if you can only save a little, it adds
                    up over time.</p>

                <p>There are different types of savings accounts that cater to various needs. For example, a regular
                    savings account is great for short-term goals, while a high-yield savings account offers higher
                    interest rates, making it ideal for long-term savings.</p>

                <p>An <span>interest rate</span> is the cost of borrowing money or the return on investment earned from
                    saving or
                    investing funds. It determines how much you will pay to borrow money or how much you will earn on
                    your savings.</p>

                <p>To make it clear, let's imagine that you put aside $200 every month, annual interest rate - 7%.</p>

                <table class="savings-table">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Time Period</th>
                        <th>Total Savings ($)</th>
                        <th>Interest Earned ($)</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>

                        <td>1,591.23</td>

                        <td>15,059.31</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>20 Year</td>
                        <td>104,566.24</td>
                        <td>64,566.24</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>Experts recommend having an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund acts
                    as a financial safety net in case of unexpected events like job loss or medical emergencies.</p>
                <h3>Managing Daily Expenses</h3>
                <p>Daily expenses can add up quickly, often eating into your savings without you even realizing it.
                    That’s why it’s important to track your spending and find ways to cut unnecessary costs. Simple
                    habits like bringing your lunch to work instead of eating out, or brewing your coffee at home
                    instead of buying it from a café, can make a big difference.</p>

                <p>Another effective strategy is to categorize your spending into fixed expenses (like rent or mortgage
                    payments) and variable expenses (like groceries or entertainment). This helps you identify areas
                    where you can cut back if needed.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> According to surveys, the average person spends about $1,100 a year on
                    coffee alone. Small changes in daily habits can lead to significant savings.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Managing Debt Wisely</h3>
                <p>Debt is a part of life for many people, but managing it wisely is crucial to maintaining financial
                    health. There are different types of debt: "good debt", like student loans or mortgages, which can
                    help you invest in your future, and "bad debt," like high-interest credit card debt, which can
                    quickly become overwhelming if not managed properly.</p>

                <p>The key to managing debt is to prioritize paying off high-interest debt first while making sure to
                    meet the minimum payments on all your debts. This approach can save you a lot of money in interest
                    over time. Additionally, creating a repayment plan can help you stay on track and avoid falling into
                    deeper debt.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The average American household has over $6,000 in credit card debt.
                    Paying just the minimum amount each month can keep you in debt for years.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Credit Scores</h3>
                <p>Your credit score is a number that represents your creditworthiness, or how likely you are to repay
                    borrowed money. Lenders use this score to decide whether to offer you credit, like a loan or credit
                    card, and at what interest rate. A higher score means better loan terms and lower interest rates,
                    which can save you a lot of money. The FICO® Score is the most popular. FICO Scores range between
                    300 to 850.</p>

                <p>Several factors affect your credit score, including your payment history, the amount of debt you owe,
                    and the length of your credit history. To maintain a good credit score, it’s important to pay your
                    bills on time, keep your credit card balances low, and avoid opening too many new credit accounts at
                    once.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> A credit score above 700 is considered good, while a score above 800
                    is excellent. Only about 21% of Americans have a credit score of 800 or higher.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Building Wealth Over Time</h3>
                <p>Building wealth is a long-term process that requires consistent saving and investing. The earlier you
                    start, the more time your money has to grow through the power of compound interest, where the
                    interest you earn also earns interest. This can turn small, regular contributions into a significant
                    sum over time.</p>

                <p>Automating your savings and investments is one of the easiest ways to stay on track. Many people set
                    up automatic transfers to a savings or investment account each month, ensuring they are consistently
                    building their wealth without having to think about it.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> If you invest $200 a month at a 7% annual return, you could accumulate
                    over $500,000 in 40 years.</p>

                <h3>Planning for Retirement</h3>
                <p>Planning for retirement is about ensuring you have enough savings to maintain your lifestyle when
                    you're no longer working. It's crucial to understand your future needs and save accordingly. There
                    are several types of retirement accounts that offer tax benefits and help your money grow over
                    time.</p>

                <p>A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan offered by employers that allows you to contribute a portion of
                    your salary before taxes are taken out. In 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 per year if you're
                    under 50, or $30,500 if you're 50 or older. Contributions to a 401(k) are tax-deductible, and
                    earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.</p>

                <p>Another option is an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). There are two main types: Traditional IRAs
                    and Roth IRAs. In 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500 per year to an IRA, or $7,500 if you're 50
                    or older. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free
                    withdrawals in retirement.</p>

                <p>Starting early is key to building a substantial retirement fund. The earlier you begin saving, the
                    more time your money has to grow through the power of compound interest.</p>

                <div class="image-placeholder">Image</div>

                <h3>Protecting Your Finances</h3>
                <p>Insurance is an essential part of financial planning because it protects you from unexpected expenses
                    that could otherwise drain your savings. Common types of insurance include health, life, auto, and
                    homeowners or renters insurance.</p>

                <p>Health insurance, for example, helps cover medical costs, while life insurance provides financial
                    support to your family if something happens to you. It’s important to review your insurance policies
                    regularly to ensure they provide adequate coverage as your life circumstances change.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The average cost of a three-day hospital stay in the U.S. is about
                    $30,000. Without health insurance, such expenses can be financially devastating.</p>

                <h3>Setting Financial Goals</h3>
                <p>Setting financial goals gives you direction and motivation to manage your money effectively. These
                    goals can be short-term, like saving for a vacation, or long-term, like buying a home or retiring
                    comfortably.</p>

                <p>To achieve your goals, it’s important to create a plan and stick to it. Start by writing down your
                    goals, estimating how much money you’ll need, and setting a timeline. Regularly reviewing and
                    adjusting your plan will help you stay on track.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> Only about 20% of people have written financial goals, but those who
                    do are more likely to achieve them.</p>
