                <h3>What is the Stock Market?</h3>
                <p>The stock market is a place where shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Shares
                    represent ownership in a company. When you buy shares, you become part-owner of that company.
                    Companies raise money by selling stocks. They use this money to grow and improve their business.
                    Shareholders can buy and sell stocks amongst themselves at agreed prices. It's a vital indicator of
                    an economy's health, reflecting the confidence of investors and consumers. For individuals, the
                    stock market offers an opportunity to grow wealth over time.</p>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, is considered the
                    world's oldest stock exchange still in use.</p>

                <h3>Key Market Participants</h3>
                <p>Let’s dive into the key players in the stock market:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Individual Investors:</span> Everyday people like you and me who buy and sell stocks. They
                        often aim to build personal wealth. For example: A retired teacher investing to increase her
                        retirement funds.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Institutional Investors:</span> Large organizations such as pension funds, mutual funds,
                        and insurance companies that invest vast amounts of money. For example: A mutual fund like
                        Vanguard or BlackRock.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Market Makers:</span> Firms or individuals who ensure that there is always a buyer for a
                        sold stock and a seller for stock somebody wants to buy, helping to keep the market flowing
                        smoothly. For example: Big banks or specialized companies on stock exchanges.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Stockbrokers:</span> Licensed professionals who buy and sell stocks on behalf of their
                        clients. For example: Companies like Charles Schwab or individuals working in brokerage firms.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is one of the largest stock markets
                    in the world and was established way back in 1792!</p>

                <h3>Understanding Stocks and Shares</h3>
                <p>Stocks, also known as shares, represent ownership in a company. When you buy stocks, you become a
                    part shareholder of the company. Companies issue stocks to raise money. Instead of taking a loan
                    from a bank, a company can sell shares to the public, and people who buy these become part
                    owners.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">
                    <img src="img/png/AI_T_L7-2.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto" alt="picture">
                </div>
                <p>Stocks are bought and sold on stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the
                    NASDAQ. To buy stocks, you generally need a broker—this can be a person or an online platform—that
                    acts as a middleman between you and the stock markets.</p>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> If you had invested $1,000 in Amazon when it first went public in
                    1997, your investment would be worth over $1,000,000 today!</p>

                <h3>The Art of Buying and Selling Stocks</h3>
                <p>Buying stocks allows you to invest in companies you believe will grow in value over time. If the
                    company does well, the price of your shares could increase, and you might also receive dividends,
                    which are payouts of the company's profits.</p>

                <p><span>Tips for Smart Trading:</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversify: Like not putting all eggs in one basket, don't invest all your money in one stock or
                        sector.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stay Informed: Keep up with financial news as if keeping up with weather reports before heading
                        out.
                    </li>
                    <li>Set Goals: Know your financial goals, just as you plan destinations on a trip.</li>
                    <li>Be Patient: Stock investments often pay off better with time, similar to planting a tree and
                        waiting for it to grow.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> Apple Inc. was almost bankrupt in 1997 until a $150 million investment
                    from Microsoft. It’s now one of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to Stock Analysis</h3>
                <p>The primary goal of stock analysis is to predict what will happen to the prices of stocks in the
                    future so that investors can make profitable investment decisions.</p>
                <p>There are two main types of stock analysis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Fundamental Analysis:</span> Involves looking at the underlying health of a company to
                        determine the stock's value.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Technical Analysis:</span> Involves examining price patterns and trends on stock
                        charts to forecast future movements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risk Management</h3>
                <p>Risk management is essentially the process of making and carrying out decisions that will minimize
                    the adverse effects of risk on an organization. It's like playing a strategic game where you need to
                    think several steps ahead to safeguard your assets.</p>
                <p>Risks can be categorized into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial Risks (like losing money on an investment),</li>
                    <li>Operational Risks (like machinery breaking down),</li>
                    <li>Strategic Risks (like entering a new market), and</li>
                    <li>Environmental Risks (like natural disasters).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Risk Management can be broken down into a simple cycle:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify Risks: Determine what could go wrong.</li>
                    <li>Assess Risks: Understand the impact and likelihood of the risks.</li>
                    <li>Prioritize Risks: Decide which risks need immediate attention.</li>
                    <li>Implement Solutions: Take steps to reduce the risks.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and Review: Keep an eye on the solutions and tweak them as needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> After the Titanic sank in 1912, greatly increased lifeboat
                    requirements became a standard practice in shipbuilding and operations, illustrating how a response
                    to a catastrophic risk can shape an entire industry.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Market Indices</h3>
                <p>A market index is a metric that tracks the performance of a group of stocks. These stocks could
                    represent the entire market or specific sectors like technology, transportation, or utilities. The
                    purpose of a market index is to give investors and economists an idea of the general trend and
                    health of the financial market.</p>

                <h3>Trading Psychology</h3>
                <p>Trading Psychology refers to the mental and emotional aspects that will determine how traders make
                    decisions and manage their positions in the market. The ability to maintain discipline, control
                    emotions, and operate within a planned framework are key components under this topic.</p>
                <div class="lesson__picture">

                </div>
                <p>Here's a look at some common emotional biases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Fear and Greed:</span> These are primary emotions driving financial markets. Fear can
                        cause traders to sell off their holdings too early, while greed can lead them to hold on for too
                        long.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Confirmation Bias:</span> Traders might look for information that supports their
                        initial analysis or prediction while ignoring contradictions.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Overconfidence:</span> When traders have consecutive wins, they might become
                        overconfident, which can lead to overlooking risks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Interesting Fact:</span> Studies show that about 40% of trading decisions are influenced by
                    emotions, especially in novice traders.</p>

                <h3>Common Trading Strategies</h3>
                <p>Trading strategies are systematic methods used by traders to buy and sell securities in the financial
                    markets. These strategies are based on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of

                        day. Traders close out positions by the end of the day to avoid the risk of significant price

                    </li>
                    <li><span>Swing Trading:</span> Involves holding positions for several days to capitalize on
                        expected upward or downward market shifts. This strategy requires patience and a good
                        understanding of market trends.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Position Trading:</span> A longer-term strategy where traders hold positions for
                        weeks, months, or even years, focusing on the asset's big price movements.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Scalping:</span> A strategy used to make small profits on minor price changes, usually
                        immediately after trade execution based on real-time market conditions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    pieces of a company.</p>
